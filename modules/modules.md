#Modules

Modules can be used to optimise, increase proformance, decrease the files size and restructure code in an easier to maintain way.

With Angular you have to explisitly tell it about whats in your code. By using modules you have to be clear about what you do need and inversly what you don't need. This will allow you to strip out all the things you dont need.
